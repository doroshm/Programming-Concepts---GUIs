Homework 5 – Part A 
Provide a brief definition of the following terms (in the interface 
programming context):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Self-documenting - refers to code that does not require 
any comments to help the user understand, the code already
has variable names set to things close to human speech. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Global variable - refers to a variable that can
be called upon anywhere from a script or function, without
the need to set local variables everytime. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Local variable - refers to a variable that can
only be accessed within the confines of its own local
function. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Scope - refers to the visibility of a variable within
the specified location.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Syntax error - an error within a code that stops it from
working like it was intended, like misspelling, and can be 
caught before running the code using a compiler or human fix. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Runtime error - even without syntax errors, and error is only 
found after running the code, and something is wrong with a calculation
or order of how your code is ran, and sometimes harder to find.
