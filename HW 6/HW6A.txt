Homework 6 – Part A 
Provide a brief definition of the following terms (in the interface 
programming context):

 Loop - used to run code multiple times, where each time it runs
it uses a different value
 Iteration - the name for each different execution of code when ran
over multiple times until the final goal is reached
 Infinite loop - often refered to as while loop, where a code will
run forever until a condition is true
 Off-by-one error - when using loops, it is possible to make a mistake
where the boundaries given in the loop is one too many or one too few
 Increment/Decrement - either adding 1 or subtracting 1 from a value,
useful for loops when trying to meet a certain boundary
